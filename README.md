# Stock Index Prediction Using ANN

A Python-based application utilizing neural networks (NN) and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict future prices in a qualified and quantized manner with high accuracy and realism
Here we use Django to create a web application.




#üì¶ Pre-requirements

To run this project, you will need to add the following 

- `python` tries to install  the Python version. this project  is built on Python version 3.7.2.

- `requirements.txt` which you will find in the projects, In this it consists of a few Python modules.

- `good network` for installing the required libraries and files.

- `code editor or IDE`  visual studio code or pycharm  or any other you are comfortable with.



# üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

1. First, install Python if you already have Python in your system hit  this `python --version` in your terminal or cmd to know the Python version (try to install Python 3.7.2).

   -  [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  (Here you can find the latest releases of python)
   - [python 3.7.2 version](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/) (which this project was build)


## üêç Using Anaconda (suggested Process)

- First, install the latest [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version.
- Next install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)
- To create a virtual environment follow these commands in your terminal or cmd.

```
conda create --name  virtualenvironmentname pythonversion
conda activate virtualenvname
```

- here virtual environment name can be anything and whatever Python version is required
  
example: you can type the below commands as it is meant for your project.

```
conda create --name venv python=3.7.2
conda activate venv
```

- here I have created a venv named virtual environment with Python version 3.7.2 which is required for this project, Follow step2 and step3.


2. next clone or download this project from the [github repo](https://github.com/yaswanthteja/Stock-Index-Prediction-Using-Ann), Here i have given all the files that are required for this project, And I also mentioned some references and a few documents for  make it easy.

3.  If you want just the project then  [click here](https://github.com/yaswanthteja/Stock-Index-Prediction-Using-Ann/tree/master/InternationalStock) (or)check out the code folder where  you find the internationalstock folder  you will find all the project requirements over there, download or clone it and follow the steps.

#  üìÇ File Structure of this project

```bash
internationalstock
  |----internationalstock
  |----admins
  |---- assets
  |----media
  |----users
 db.sqlite3
 manage.py
 requirements.txt

```

4.  Now open  internationalstock folder  you can find a few files,
now we need to install a few dependencies for our project which you will find in requirements.txt.

5. now open your terminal and navigate to your project location by using the cd command
  - for example:  your project is in the E folder/downloads/internationalstock, now open your cmd  or terminal type cd E:\downloads\internationalstock,  and hit enter
  -  simply copy the project location and open your terminal type cd and paste the location over there
  -  now in our project, you can find the requirements.txt file 
<be>


# ‚öíÔ∏è installing the modules 

6. now type the following command in the terminal
#### using pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- it just installs the following dependencies of the project

- or manually install these  by placing pip install
example: pip install django==2.2

```
 django==2.2
 sklearn==0.0
 pandas==0.24.0
 xgboost==1.2.1
 statsmodels==0.12.1
 seaborn==0.10.0
 matplotlib==3.1.3
numpy==1.17.2
```


# ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

## üñ≤Ô∏è Run server


7. Type the following command in your terminal to run the Django server in your local host 

```
python manage.py runserver

       (or)

py manage.py runserver
```
8.  Now open your browser  and hit this on browser 127.0.0.1:8000/ you will find and web application  over there

   - If your facing any error like(main loop) you can type this command in your terminal

   ```
    py manage.py runserver --nothreading --noreload
   ```



# ¬ÆÔ∏è Registration

- After that you can see a web application on your browser.
- In this, you need to create an account, so go  and click on registration which you can find  top of the web application, and try to fill in all details that are required.
- now click on  the register  button
- Now you need to wait until the admin gives you the access.


# üÖ∞Ô∏è Admin

-  In the admin panel you can access admin tasks, To access  these you need to go to the admin page, you can find that on the web application page.
- Then login with the admin login details.

```
login: admin
password: admin
```
- Here we can  access the admin page by using the above login ID and password
- On the admin page you can find users then you can give access to the users  from over there.


- if you are using Anaconda process you need to deactivate the virtual environment
- if you want to deactivate the virtual environment type the following command in your terminal.
  
```
conda deactivate
```
